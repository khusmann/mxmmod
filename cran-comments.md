## Notes

CRAN package check on solaris fails: (https://cloud.r-project.org/web/checks/check\_results\_mxmmod.html)

But this is due to a segfault in the OpenMx dependency: (https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check\_results\_OpenMx.html)

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 3.6.3
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.3
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results
